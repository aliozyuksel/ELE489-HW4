# Deep Learning - CNN on MNIST

This repository contains a comprehensive deep learning project that explores the training, optimization, and evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The notebook walks through baseline model creation, architectural experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, and failure case analysis.

## Files

- `hw4.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook that includes model definitions, training logs, visualizations, and evaluation results.
- `plots/`: Folder containing saved loss and accuracy plots of different model configurations. **_Created automatically_**.
- `models/`: Folder containing model architecture visualizations generated by `visualkeras`. **_Created automatically_**
- `logs/`: Folder with saved training history (loss/accuracy per epoch) for reproducibility and later use. **_Created automatically_**

## Dataset

- **Dataset**: [MNIST Handwritten Digit Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- **Samples**: 60,000 training and 10,000 test images.
- **Image Size**: 28×28 grayscale images.
- **Classes**: 10 digit classes (0 through 9).
- **How to load**: The data is loaded **_automatically_** inside the notebook when you run it.

## What’s Inside?

### Baseline CNN
- A simple CNN architecture with two convolutional blocks followed by dense layers.
- Trained using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss for 10 epochs.
- Performance metrics and visualizations included.

### Architectural Variants
- Deeper networks with additional convolutional layers.
- Models with different kernel sizes (1×1, 5×5).
- Experiments with various activation functions (LeakyReLU, Tanh).
- Use of BatchNormalization, GlobalAveragePooling, and skip connections.

### Hyperparameter Experiments
- Varying learning rates, optimizers (Adam vs SGD), batch sizes, dropout rates, and weight initialization strategies.
- Each experiment includes performance graphs and validation comparisons.

### Deliberately Failed Models
- Three models are intentionally designed to underperform using poor hyperparameters or architectural choices.
- Includes detailed analysis of why they failed using training logs and loss/accuracy plots.

## How to Run
1. Install the requirements down below.
2. Then, run the notebook file.

---

## Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow visualkeras
```
Some of the libraries must be built-in libraries. 
If there is lacking one, then you must install them by hand
Those are:
1. os 
2. json
3. warnings
4. datetime
